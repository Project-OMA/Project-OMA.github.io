The E3 Web Editor, developed using HTML and JavaScript, enables the creation of maps for indoor environments such as buildings, malls, airports, and residences. With a 2D drawing approach, the E3 Editor stands out as a tool designed for creating audio-haptic maps, where the O&M instructor draws a map for their lessons, organizing spaces, adding elements, and defining the objectives students must achieve (for example, finding a specific object, going to a location, and returning).
