The Navigable Space (ENA) allows the generation of a virtual environment based on the activity designed by the O&M instructor, intended for use by people with visual impairments (PVI). This environment is structured as a first-person serious game, developed using the Unity 2020.3 engine, along with Google's SDK for VR development and the UAP (Unity Accessibility Plugin) for accessibility functions.
