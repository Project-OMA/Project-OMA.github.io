# Description

Data Provenance (DP) combined with Game Learning Analytics methods has proved to play an essential role in the decision-making 
processes of serious game re-design and the monitoring of students by teachers. In this context, this project aims to investigate how PD, 
Data Visualization, and Virtual Reality (VR) methods can help Orientation and Mobility (O&M) teachers in the process of teaching O&M to 
people who are blind (PwB). We expect that, as a result of this research, O&M teachers will have a greater capacity to estimate the 
learner's evolution with the help of such practices and customize them to maximize their engagement and learning.
